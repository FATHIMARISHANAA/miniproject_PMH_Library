    Introduction
The PM Haneef Memorial Library Management System (LMS) is designed to automate and streamline library operations, enhancing the user experiences. This system covers book
loans, returns, cataloging, and user services to improve overall efficiency.A preliminary study was conducted on the library system at the PM Haneef MemorialLibrary, Perinthalmanna, revealed several manual processes. These include paper-based user registration, manual book detail entries, physical ledger logging for book issuance and returns, and manual overdue fine calculations. The proposed LMS aims to address these issues with advanced automation and optimization. Online registration will reduce manual entry errors, and automated catalog management will streamline book updates. Digital logging will manage book issuance and returns, while automated fine calculations will simplify overdue management. Automated reporting and analytics will enhance data security and provide detailed insights. Additionally, also able to place holds on checked-out items, view the next available dates for borrowed items, and access items according to the date of pre-booking. Key features include efficient online book search, allowing patrons to search for booksonline, and the ability to reserve and borrow books with ease. The system will provide digital access according to the date of pre-booking and ensure scalability to adapt to future needs.

Objective and Scope of Project

The objectives of the LMS are to develop a comprehensive software solution to automate and optimize library operations, improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance user satisfaction. The project will create a web-based interface and mobile application for managing library services, integrating with educational platforms and payment gateways. The solution is designed to be scalable to meet future needs. The PMH Library Management System will significantly improve library operations at the PM Haneef Memorial Library.
